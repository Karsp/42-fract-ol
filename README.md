# Fract-ol [![daviles-'s 42 fract-ol Score](https://badge42.vercel.app/api/v2/cljnk09b8001108mj13orwiyl/project/3099410)](https://github.com/JaeSeoKim/badge42)
The goal of this project is to create a small fractal exploration program.

This project was carried out using miniLibX, the graphic library of campus 42. A library with certain limitations that enhances creativity and problem solving.
The goal is for us to discover and use the mathematical notion of complex numbers, become familiar with the concept of optimization in CGI, and practice event handling.

Main requirements:
1-Rendering
Your program must offer the Julia and Mandelbrot sets.
The mouse wheel zooms in and out and zooms almost infinitely (within from the limits of the computer).
You should be able to create a different Julia set using the program parameters.
A parameter will be passed through the CLI to define the type of fractal displayed.
If a parameter is not entered, or if the parameter is invalid, the program it will display a list of available parameters and exit successfully.
You should use at least a few colors to show the depth of each fractal.

2 - Graphic representation
Your program has to display the image in a window.
The ESC key should close the window and exit the program cleanly.
Clicking the cross in the window frame should close the window and close the program cleanly.

3 - Bonus
One more different fractal.
The zoom follows the current position of the mouse.
In addition to zoom: move with arrows.
Make the color range change

4 - My personal bonus
Instructions and personalized messages in every step. From the compilation to the execution of the program.
Resolution change from the keyboard to enhance the effect of fractals.
Changing the color set from the keyboard.
Use of the wheel and mouse buttons to zoom.
In Julia set, you can use choose between three ways to set the parameters.
  Right click on any part of the window.
  Press M key to enter live mode and change the values while moving mouse on screen.
  Press J to change from a list of iconic Julia sets.
